# SecretTracker

Secret tracker works as a tool for gamers who feel the need to keep track of the secrets they find along the way. Secret tracker allows players to enter the locations and secrets (such as locked doors) they find along with a screenshot and list the secrets by their locations. Players can also keep track of the tools (items, skills etc.) they find and form connections between secrets and tools.
